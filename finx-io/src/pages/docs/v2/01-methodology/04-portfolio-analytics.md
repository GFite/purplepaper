# Portfolio Analytics

A "Portfolio" is a collection of securities grouped together for the purpose of analysis. The portfolio can be 
expressed as a snapshot (single-date view), or as a set of time-series data showing the group's details over time.

Portfolio Analytics cover a range of use cases, including:
- Portfolio Holdings & Security Analysis
- Compliance Reporting
- Risk Reporting
- Risk Analysis
- Performance Reporting
- Performance Attribution
- Re-Balancing
- Portfolio Compression
- Hedging / Risk Transfer

While our calculations are standardized, you may choose from any of them to be represented or used in various report 
templates. To learn more about the reports we offer and to see examples, please [contact us](mailto:info@fiteanalytics.com).
