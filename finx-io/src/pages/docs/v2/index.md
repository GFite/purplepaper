Welcome! The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the FINX ecosystem. 
If you are new to FINX, you might want to check out the <Link to="/docs/v2/protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</Link> or <Link to="/faq">FAQ</Link> first.

FINX is a Decentralized Exchange (<span><strong>DEX</strong></span>) that provides a way for all Capital Market Participants 
to conduct decentralized commerce in crypto.

Underwriters, Insurers, Ratings Agencies, Collateral Valuators and others can provide services to Corporate Borrowers that act as collateral against Collateralized Pools on the Ethereum Mainnet. The ERC20 contracts stipulate 
repayment periods, interest models, liquidity provisions, workout and dispute resolution.

FINX is committed to building more efficient counterparty arrangements on the decentralized web.

FINX is currently conducting a <InternalLink to="/blog/uni"><strong>Genesis Token Sale</strong></InternalLink> from February 15 through March 15.

For a high-level overview of FINX, see the <Link to='/blog/uniswap-v2'>introductory blog post</Link>.
