## Abstract

This paper describes the mission and activities of Fite Analytics. It is intended to be read by team members, partners, 
customers, or anyone interested in why we're here and what we do.

## Background

Fite Analytics was formed in March 2016 by Geoff Fite. Dick Mule joined in May 2017 and Sonia Dixon in February 2018. In August 
2018 we signed our first customer, [Moreton Capital Management LLC](https://moretoncm.com) and they remain a happy customer of 
portfolio-level analytics and reports.

In 2019 we began to work with Northern Trust as we obtained global coverage of the bond markets. In 2020 we became the primary 
analytics provider to [Northern Trust](https://northerntrust.com); they loved the service so much they became a minority 
owner of the company.

Our story is an example of what can be accomplished by combining deep industry expertise with new technologies and 
a desire to make customers happy.

## Mission

Our mission is to give Capital Markets Participants more choice in Security and Portfolio Analytics.

Up until now, the industry has been overwhelmingly dominated by a few monopoly providers who extract high fees for the services they 
provide. While the value of these services is undeniable, the cost of implementation and managing multiple vendors creates 
wasted expense and unnecessary work.

Additionally, many of the high quality inputs to generating analytics must be source separately and then assembled by technical staff. Finding 
quantitative analysts who can both understand the complex methodologies involved **and** write the code to utilize the inputs 
has created a significant barrier to analyzing complex securities such as mortgage-backed instruments.

We fulfill our mission to provide choice by covering the entire global bond market to produce street-standard results, available 
without implementation on the cloud.

## Services

Our services are offered as a subscription model that grants access to our output. Output is delivered as:
- APIs
- Batch Processing
- Customer Reports

The competitiveness of our service is based on 4 Building Blocks: Coverage, Quality, Speed and Price

### Coverage

"Coverage" means that the platform has the terms, conditions, relevant schedules, reference rates, and any other 
inputs required to complete the analytics requested. We do not simply "model securities", but rather we analyze every 
security's actual terms and conditions, and if that security is a complex basket of other instruments, or pools, or even pools 
of pools, we analyze those components as well.

Thus we take a "Bottoms-Up" approach to analytics as the street has come to expect a high degree of precision 
with respect to cash flow forecasting and sensitivity analysis.

The Fite Analytics platform possesses the widest representation of securities next to Bloomberg. This was assembled 
over the course of 3 years across multiple data and ancillary model providers and is the critical first ingredient to the Fite 
Analytics service.

***Our coverage means that our customers can identify a security merely by its Secuity Identifier (CUSIP or ISIN) and do not need to include any 
other data describing the security in their request. We have all of the source refernce data on system.***

Please see our [security types coverage list](/docs/v2/security-coverage) for more information on specific securities and 
to check if we have information on an individual security identifier.

### Quality

"Quality" means that the results of our calculations 1) match street-standard results as expressed in terminals; and 2) provide 
consistent results that can be easily explained and defended when challenged. We encourage comparison of our results to any other platform.

Modeling in Capital Markets is a combination of highly-evolved thinking on the mechanics of risk with strangely idiosyncratic 
treatments and assumptions that may not be obvious to the academic student of CFA study guides. For example, we go 
to great lengths to predict callability of a municipal bond at some point in the future, but at the same time we price 
the same instrument on a 5-year Muni Curve that does not contain callable bonds.

The Fite Analtyics platform is the software representation of accumulated market knowledge over 30+ years and is therefore 
able to calculate every type of security with accuracy and completeness. We understand how to treat every type of 'note', from 
Savings Bonds to CLOs and everything in between.

### Speed

One limitation of current solutions in capital markets analytics is that they are extremely slow and cannot be 
expanded or accelerated. This is likely because there has been limited choice (and therefore competition) amongst analytics 
vendors, but nevertheless it has been common to wait for ***hours*** for security analytics to be run on some very 
well-known branded solutions.

Our goal is to run any number of securities in less than 1 hour. We currently support runs of over 500,000 securities in a 
single batch returned in 40 minutes or less, and we expect these times to continue to be reduced as we adopt new 
technologies.

The cloud platform that underpins the analytics includes a huge data repository that provides extremely low-latency
data queries. We generally see less than 5 milliseconds required to read any single data point, and the ability to 
handle very large data sets quickly makes a massive difference in computational speed. C++ is always fast, but getting the 
data to the engine - and getting it back to the requester - is solved by the significant advances in data persistence 
and retrieval technologies. 

### Price

Finally, the lack of choice and innovation has meant that current vendors have been able to charge fees that do 
not represent the cost of goods in the service. Rather, most large vendors in FinTech have very large distribution 
organizations that sustain very high cost of sales which include executive salaries, HQ buildings, golf tournaments and 
the like.

Our approach is to dramatically undercut the current pricing in the industry, by simply keeping our cost of sales 
as low as possible and by adding a small markup on the cost of goods that we pay our suppliers and Amazon AWS. This has 
the effect of making a profitable business for everyone - data vendors, our customers, and us - by eliminating wasted expense.

You don't always get what you pay for in this industry, and we'd like to change that.

## Structure

Fite Analytics is closely-held and has less than 10 employees. We expect it to stay that way until it makes sense 
to hire more people, but we will always attempt to remain the highest-quality lowest-priced competitor in the marketplace.

We charge for our services as a subscription with payment terms that suit our customers.
