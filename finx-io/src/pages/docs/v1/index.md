title: FINX V1
---

<Info>
  FINX V1 was a prototype Smart Contract network build on AWS Managed Blockchain. It is not available to new users at this time
since the availability of Ethereum 2.
</Info>

FINX V1 was the first version of the protocol, built as a bespoke solution for Debt Obligations amongst 3 financial institutions.
It was designed to allow for Value Proxy contracts to be used in conjunction with Market Value contracts so that liability pools could
be evaluated automatically and ingest various inputs as oracle.

The design principle behind FINX is to eliminate unnecessary forms of rent extraction by intermediaries. Smart Contract protocols allows faster, more efficient exchange. Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized.

FINX is not open source software. This is a major reason for moving to Ethereum 2 in FINX V2 as an extension (fork) of the Uniswap V2 contracts, and therefore is open source and functions as a public good. There is no central token or platform fee. No special treatment is given to early investors, adopters, or developers. Token listing is open and free. All smart contract functions are public and all upgrades are opt-in.

This site will serve as a project overview for FINX - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it. These docs are actively being worked on and more information will be added on an ongoing basis.
