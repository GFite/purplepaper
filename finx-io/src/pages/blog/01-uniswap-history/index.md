# V0 â€” FINX Genesis

We launched FINX as an AWS Managed Blockchain project in mid-2020. The idea was for the network to serve as an issuing platform
for cashflow-producing assets that would normally (and very expensively) be structured into Asset Backed Securities, wrapped in legal 
language, placed with a broker, and sold to institutional investors.

The idea was novel - let's take the biggest part of the Debt Capital Markets and take out the traditional data vendors. I won't identify them
here, but the traditional vendors in the structured finance space enjoy unregulated monopoly status. By connecting the holders 
of the Asset with the Ratings Agency necessary for placement in regulated portfolios, and having them interact directly to produce 
a saleble financial arrangement was the primary purpose.

The idea worked well, but it became obvious that a Private Network was antithetical to the whole idea. The traditional financial world says one 
thing - that they have the interests of Investors and Transparency at their core - but they act very differently. Dark Pools dominate 
equity trading but make price discovery impossible in exchange for liquidity, Strucutred Products have layers of asset pools and interconnecting 
logic that is impossible to figure out - you get the idea.

So, when it became clear to us that Ethereum was both 1) an answer to much of the challenges of coordinating complex logical 
interaction amongst newtork participants, and 2) incredibly misunderstood. What an opportunity to make open source finally issue 
dividends in the capital markets!

In this very frontier-like time that we find ourselves, it might be easy to look at some of the effects of ERC20 and say "that 
can't possibly be right! There must be something silly afoot." I challenge you to look at it from another direction:

When we see Stablecoin - that is practically no different that $US - returning annual yields of 20% or more, I challenge you to consider that 
perhaps the capital pools simply haven't leveled off yet, and - more importantly - it appears that the waste in our existing financial 
system has parasitically sucked all the returns out of the market.

Necessity is the mother of invention, don't you think?
