## FINCAD Announces Comprehensive Bond Data and Analytics Service



VANCOUVER, British Columbia — FINCAD, a pioneer in providing pricing, modeling, and risk analytics, today announced a new partnership with Fite Analytics, a leading innovator and provider of bond data and analytics solutions, expanding FINCAD’s market-leading derivatives analytics services with comprehensive fixed income data and insights.



“Quantitative analysts, portfolio managers, risk managers, and other financial service professionals will be able to review any sector of the global bond markets in one place,” said Mark D’Arcy, President and CEO of FINCAD. “FINCAD is positioned to offer its customers evaluated market data, creating a simple customer experience with comprehensive instrument coverage. Customers need only pass the security identifier to receive evaluated market data and analytics.”
FINCAD customers can easily utilize reference data for all sectors of global bond markets. Clients will be able to review and research a comprehensive overview of the risk and return characteristics of their fixed income portfolio, including yield, duration, and convexity, through a simple and direct access point and comprehensive reporting. The integration is seamless with direct access through a user-focused, cloud-based platform.



“The real-world application of this partnership is the ability to provide a combined view of risk and return at the portfolio level, encompassing both fixed income and derivative instruments,” D’Arcy continued. “It is the definition of one-stop shopping, whether your portfolio consists of derivatives, bonds, or a mix of either of these products.” This expansion follows close on the heels of the launch of FINCAD CVA, a cloud-based service helping Japanese financial institutions evaluate, account for, and report credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and debit value adjustments (DVA).
