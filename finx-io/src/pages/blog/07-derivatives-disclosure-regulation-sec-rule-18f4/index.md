# New SEC Derivatives Disclosure Rules for Hedge Funds: Rule 18f-4

#### The SEC is adopting more comprehensive approach to the regulation of fundsâ€™ use of derivatives and the other transactions. 

####The rule is effective February 2021 and compliance is expected no later than August 19, 2022.

## Summary of Rule 18f-4

The new rule changes to Section 18f of the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 are:

1. Adoption of a **Derivatives Risk Management Program** that is overseen by the fund's board of directors
2. Compliance with outer limits on fund leverage risk based on value at risk (**VaR**)
3. Reporting and record-keeping regarding use of derivatives

## Definition of Derivatives in rule 18f-4

The SEC letter states that "derivatives can reference a range of assets or metrics, such as: stocks, bonds, currencies, interest
rates, market indexes, currency exchange rates, or other assets or interests." Practically, this means any counterparty agreement 
that includes securities as an asset to be exchanged at a later date given a set of terms and conditions, either over-the-counter (OTC) 
or traded on an exchange.

## Rule 18f-4 is Designed to Limit Leverage

The reason for these changes is the realization that **leverage** is a practice to be regulated because it can potentially 
harm investors if poorly managed. Leverage is any magnification of the fund's exposure to changes in underlying prices, rates, 
or other inputs into valuation. The rule is designed to limit the overall amount 
of leverage that funds can obtain for the protection of investors, to maintain adequate assets and reserves, and to limit abuse 
(i.e., "stacking" over over-leveraging).

Futures contracts, swaps, and written options pose a risk of loss in the form of payment to counterparties, which 
**directly affects the capital structure of the fund**. In order to maintain capital adequacy in funds that use 
derivatives, **specific VaR limits** are placed on a fund's derivative positions so that any deleveraging will not result in the fund 
becoming under-capitalized.

## Rule 18f-4 Requirements

### Derivatives Management Program

A written program must be established and reviewed periodically. This program must include specifications on **stress testing, 
backtesting, internal reporting and escalation, and program review elements.**

### Daily Value at Risk (VaR) Calculations

As a limit on overall fund leverage, **daily VaR test** should be performed on a fund which is to be compared to a designated reference portfolio 
for that fund. This designated reference portfolio may be:

- an appropriate index that matches the fund's investment strategy and includes representative securities that will be traded by the fund
- the fund's unleveraged (ex-derivatives) portfolio as its own benchmark

The outer VaR limits are set at 200% relative and 20% absolute.

### Board Oversight and Reporting

The fund's board of directors must designate the fund's Risk Manager, who in turn implements the written derivatives management program. The 
rule does not specify that the board must approve the written plan, but the rule does say that the risk manager will have a direct 
(but not exclusive) reporting line to the board of directors.

### Exclusion from Derivatives Risk Management Program and Board Oversight

The daily VaR test is the minimum requirement for all funds holding derivatives, but if the absolute VaR of the fund is below 10% 
then the fund is not required to have a risk manager that has a reporting line to the board, and the board does not need to approve a written program.

## Technical Issues

This post does not cover the technical details of implementing this rule, but there are many specifics to be worked out and there 
is substantial nuance to how calculations are calibrated and how benchmarks are selected and analyzed.

###Technical issues include but are not limited to:

- Coverage of Securities and Derivatives across multiple Asset Classes 

- Value at Risk (VaR) Methodology and Calibration

- Historical Data including Asset Prices

- Stress Testing

- Trading Workflows and Cure Periods

- High Data Costs

# Conclusion

Rule 18f-4 sets out new requirements for hedge funds to track and disclose all derivatives holdings, and to limit the overall leverage 
in the system. Daily VaR calculations must be performed across all asset classes and their derivatives, with no more than 20% of the absolute 
value of the portfolio at risk due to derivatives positions.

These new requirements are substantial yet achievable, and in my opinion are an objective set of regulations and a reasonable action on the part of the SEC.
